# Graph-Classifying-gSpan
In this project, we trained different classifiers for the molecules datasets using the Pattern-based classification
approaches. The dataset contains graphs, which represent the molecules. This project aims to extract the
top-k frequent subgraphs that have high confidence from two datasets (mutagen (positive) and non-mutagen
(negative)) in order to train classifiers to predict the mutagenicity of the molecules. To this end, we used
the gSpan algorithm to extract the subgraphs based on which the classifiers are trained. Since the gSpan
algorithm was beforehand given, our effort mostly focused on defining different tasks on gSpan to extract
subgraphs and train different classifiers as requested.
